# Semigration
Tooling meant to aid in creating scripts to migrate data from DeadEiry (Data and Style templates) styling to Semantic styling.

titles.py is meant to serve as a bare-bones example usage. I will probably continue to update it as I migrate the titles over, though.

TODO:

* Download templates linked in a page more easily.
* Interactive version which opens the target page in your browser and copies the staged data to clipboard
* Simple way to check if a property value has been used before (for stats)
